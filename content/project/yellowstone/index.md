title: "Measuring Reflectivity of Microbial Mats in Yellowstone National Park"
summary: "Under the supervision of Dr. Niki Parenteau (NASA Ames) and with federal permits, I used a mobile spectrometer to measure the reflectivity of different microbial mats in the acidic environments of the Yellowstone hot springs in summer 2019. Dr. Parenteau specializes in studying the unique spectral fingerprints of these extremo-tolerant organisms, which we believe may have carpeted the early Archean Earth in a near-global layer. This will work will illuminate how we might remotely detect similar lifeforms on planets outside our solar system."
