title: "Trawling the Puget Sound to Trace the Evolutionary History of Invertebrate Organisms"
summary: "As part of the annual Astrobiology workshop at the University of Washington, my fellow grad students and I journeyed to Friday Harbor Labs to board the Rachel Carson, a UW oceanographic research vessel in fall 2019. While on-board, we supervised as the crew trawled the Puget Sound for various invertebrates. We then dissected our invertebrates in the laboratory to discuss the growing complexity demonstratedby lifeforms like bivalves, prawns, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins."
