I am a PhD student in Astronomy and Astrobiology at the University of Washington. As a member of the Virtual Planetary Laboratory, I am exploring how we will interpret spectral observations of terrestrial exoplanets with future instruments. In preparation for upcoming transmission or direct imaging missions, I am particularly interested in developing robust frameworks for interpreting the detection of biosignature gases. 

In my spare time, I enjoy combing Seattle for tostones and maduros with my partner [Joe](https://jjanizek.github.io) and my dog Toby.
