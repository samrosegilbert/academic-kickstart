summary: "Using Brian Keating's 2018 book Losing the Nobel Prize as a primary text, I analyzed the infamous story of the BICEP science team in their search for proof of the universe's anistropy. While the scientific community deemed their efforts a great failure, I found an important human story underlying the team's trials: we do our best work when we truly work together towards a common goal. Conversely, when we operate in an environment built on the fear of failure and its consequences, we suffer academically and more importantly, we suffer personally."
# abstract: For me, the coolest part of being a scientist is using data to tell a story. In this way, scientists are kind of like the authors of our universe. An unfortunate side effect of the scientist’s role as author is that we rarely think to write the story of the scientists themselves. Tonight I want to bring the story of one group of scientists out from behind the curtain and into the spotlight. The story I’m telling you tonight has everything: it has science, it has drama, it has egos, and it has really esoteric vector math. It also encapsulates a lot of what is wrong with how some people do science today. Our story tonight is about what happens when we privilege an individualistic and competitive science over a collaborative science.
